The Part2.py file is attached to the submission, however upon opening the file, there is a link commented out at the top of the file to the google colab where the file was orginally created. I would recommend clicking this link and going to the google collab where all the information is organized. Once you have opened the link, begin by running the imports block of code at the top to import all the libraries used. After doing so, you can proceed to run the second block which contains all the methods created to perform K-means clustering. Then finally run the last block of code which is the main method and will return the results of the various k-values. This should take about 30-45 seconds. After running this block, you will get 5 different trials, each showing the different k number of clusters and the SSE.
